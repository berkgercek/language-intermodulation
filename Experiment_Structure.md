# Structure of language intermodulation MEG task

The experiment will be conducted on subjects:
 - Who are native speakers of English
 - Have normal or corrected-to-normal vision
 - Have no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders

The experiment will consist of a series of trials in which two text stimuli are presented on either side of a visual fixation dot. Subjects will be given 2000 ms to observe the pair of stimuli, which may or may not together form a phrase. The possible pairings are as follows:
 - Two-word phrase pairs
 - Two-word non-phrase pairs
 - Non-word pairs in which at least one string is a non-word (e.g. "xdsdf")

There will be a variable duration inter-trial period (uniform distribution, 1-3 seconds) before the start of the next trial, once the stimuli have disappeared from the screen. Optionally, some trials will be followed by a memory task in which subjects will be asked whether a given word appeared in the previous, and must respond yes or no.

The two stimuli will flicker with different rates of either 17 or 19 Hz. The flicker rate of each stimulus will be constant within a trial, and will change between trials. The flicker rate will be chosen randomly at the trial start.

Acquisition of each possible pair of stimuli will be repeated 3 times in 3 different blocks (once per block), with self-directed breaks. The stimuli within a block will be randomized in category (phrase, non-phrase, non-word).

For each category there will be 60 possible pairs, resulting in 540 total trials per subject. With the duration of the stimulus and ITI this results in a total experiment time of 36 minutes.
