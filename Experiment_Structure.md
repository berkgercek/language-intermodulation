# Structure of language intermodulation MEG task

The experiment will be conducted on subjects:
 - Who are native speakers of English
 - Have normal or corrected-to-normal vision
 - Have no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders

The experiment will consist of a series of trials in which two text stimuli are presented on either side of a visual fixation dot. Subjects will be given **XXX** ms to observe the pair of stimuli, which may or may not together form a phrase. The possible pairings are as follows:
 - Two-word phrase pairs
 - Two-word non-phrase pairs
 - Non-word pairs in which at least one string is a non-word (e.g. "xdsdf")

There will be a **fixed/variable** duration inter-trial period before the start of the next trial, once the stimuli have disappeared from the screen. Optionally, some trials will be followed by a memory task in which subjects will be asked whether a given word appeared in the **previous/last N trials**, and must respond yes or no.

The two stimuli will flicker with different rates drawn from the set **{X, Y, Z}** Hz. The flicker rate of each stimulus will be constant within a trial, and **will/will not** change between trials. The flicker rate will be chosen randomly at the **trial/experiment** start.

Acquisition of each possible pair of stimuli will be repeated **N** times in **N** different blocks (once per block), with a short break between blocks. The stimuli within a block **will/will not** be randomized in category (phrase, non-phrase, non-word).

For each category there will be **K** possible pairs, resulting in **N x K x 3** total trials per subject. With the duration of the stimulus and ITI this results in a total experiment time of **X** minutes.
